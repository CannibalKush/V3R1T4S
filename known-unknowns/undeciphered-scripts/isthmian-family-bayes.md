## The problem

In 1993, Justeson & Kaufman proposed a partial syllabic decipherment of the Isthmian script (La Mojarra Stela 1, the Tuxtla Statuette, Tres Zapotes C, the Teotihuacan-style mask) as Zoquean. Houston & Coe failed to apply it to the mask text, and Vonk (2020) argued that the corpus is too small for a unique decipherment and that a Huastecan reading fits equally well. Whether either hypothesis can be decided on the data is the open question. The corpus is about 700 tokens and about 160 sign types, and no open machine-readable transcription was confirmed. The chemvatho/isthmian-script repo (created 2025-12-22) reports preliminary log-evidence (PMZ -44.4 vs Huastecan -49.6) from hypothetical, not empirical, priors, and requires the author's prior permission for any use of its code or results. Status as of 2026-10-03: disputed and unresolved.

## What counts as a win

Either (1) a Bayes factor of at least 20 for one family, robust to 3 segmentations and to priors varied over an order of magnitude, with priors derived from cited lexical data (not hand-set), after a calibration that recovers the correct family with BF at least 20 in at least 80% of trials on Maya or Cypriot data truncated to Isthmian size; or (2) a power analysis showing that for a whole stated class of distributional methods, calibration at Isthmian size (about 700 tokens, about 160 types) recovers the correct family in fewer than 50% of trials, while the same methods succeed at 5-10x the size. 'Our method was inconclusive' alone does not count.

## Partial wins

- **p1:** Calibration success: a fully specified pipeline with priors derived from cited lexical data recovers the correct language family with BF at least 20 in at least 80% of trials on Maya or Cypriot-syllabary data truncated to Isthmian size (about 700 tokens, about 160 types), robust to 3 segmentations, reimplemented independently of the licence-restricted repo.
- **p2:** Mask-text held-out test: the Justeson-Kaufman grid frozen from La Mojarra Stela 1 alone yields, on the Teotihuacan-style mask text, a count of Zoquean lexicon matches (lexicon and vowel-latitude rules frozen beforehand) above the 99th percentile of the same count for 1,000 random grids of the same size (p < 0.01).

## How a win is checked

The verifier independently implements the pipeline from the written description (not the licence-restricted repo code), rebuilds the Isthmian transcription from the Pérez de Lara & Justeson sign catalog, and reruns calibration and the robustness table.

## Ideas to start from

Left out on purpose, so this page never spoils the hunt.

## Point your agent at it

```
set up V3R1T4S: https://github.com/elder-plinius/V3R1T4S and hunt known-unknowns/undeciphered-scripts/isthmian-family-bayes.md
```

Already set up? Say `run V3R1T4S on isthmian-family-bayes`. Your agent follows [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md): it re-checks the status, freezes its success rule, attacks, and only a three-skeptic panel can confirm a win.
