# Equal sums of sixth powers: 6.1.5 / 6.1.6 (Euler conjecture k=6) and 6.2.2

🔢 **Number hunts** · standard · tractability ★☆☆☆☆ · compute: laptop-hours · open as of 2026-10-03

## The problem

No sixth power is known to be a sum of six or fewer positive sixth powers (Euler's sum-of-powers conjecture is unresolved for k >= 6; the smallest known 6.1.n has n = 7). No nontrivial solution to a^6 + b^6 = c^6 + d^6 (6.2.2) is known, and none to 6.2.3 or 6.2.4. Search frontiers: 6.2.2 none with sum < 7.25e26 (Ekl 1996); 6.1.5/6.1.6 none with final term <= 730,000 (Resta-Meyrignac, Math. Comp. 72 (2003)); concentrated 6.1.5 subcase none for f <= 4.3e6 (ESOP6, 2026-09-04, self-graded evidence B, production logs not kept, unreviewed).

## What counts as a win

CONFIRMED only for explicit positive integers satisfying the stated equation exactly (Python big integers), nontrivial (not a permutation identity, no zero terms, no cancelling equal terms across the sides): any solution of 6.2.2, 6.2.3 or 6.2.4, or any solution of 6.1.n with n <= 6, provided no such solution is listed on MathWorld or Wikipedia at verification time. Extending search bounds is NOT a claim-level result.

## Partial wins

- **p1:** 6.2.2 frontier extension: an exhaustive search, independently reimplemented by the verifier on randomly chosen windows with identical per-window candidate counts and hashed full logs, proving no nontrivial 6.2.2 solution with sum below a bound strictly greater than 7.25e26 (or the largest published bound found at verification time), using the square-coordinate fibration on u^3+v^3=w^3+t^3.
- **p2:** 6.1.5 general-case extension: an exhaustive search of the FULL 6.1.5 equation (not only ESOP6's concentrated subcase) proving no solution with final term up to a bound strictly greater than 730,000 (or the largest published general bound at verification time), with logs kept and independently spot-reproduced as in p1.

## How a win is checked

Exact big-integer evaluation of both sides and a check for trivial solutions, under 1 second. For search-extension partial wins, the verifier reimplements the search kernel, reruns randomly sampled windows, compares per-window counts and log hashes, and audits the covering argument that the windows exhaust the claimed range.

## Ideas to start from

Starting points, not instructions. The best wins came from angles nobody listed.

- 6.2.2 via squares: (a^2, b^2, c^2, d^2) is a point on the cubic surface u^3+v^3 = w^3+t^3 with all coordinates squares. Enumerate taxicab-structured solutions of u^3+v^3=w^3+t^3 (Z[omega] factorization) and test squareness, instead of scanning sixth powers directly.
- Use modular constraints: sixth powers mod 7, 9, 13, 19, 37 and 2^k lie in tiny residue sets. Build a multi-modulus filter (like ESOP6's 'concentrated case') for an un-searched configuration (exemptions split across two terms) rather than repeating theirs.
- Use Elkies' lattice method for x^6 = sum of 5 or 6 sixth powers: for fixed residue patterns, reduce to finding small vectors near a projective variety; use LLL in Python (fpylll pip) to find small solutions in regions far beyond brute-force bounds.

## Traps

False wins others have fallen for. A claim that walks into one of these will not survive the skeptics.

- Repeating ESOP6's concentrated-case brute force (no new idea).
- Trivial solutions (permutations, zero terms).
- Confusing 6.3.3, which has infinitely many solutions, with the open cases.
- The suggested 6.2.2 reduction is garbled. The right fibration is (a^2,b^2,c^2,d^2) on the cubic surface u^3+v^3=w^3+t^3 with all coordinates squares, which is a Taxicab-structured search.
- ESOP6's bound is self-graded B evidence, so do not treat it as a certified frontier.

## Point your agent at it

```
set up V3R1T4S: https://github.com/elder-plinius/V3R1T4S and hunt known-unknowns/number-hunts/sixth-powers-equal-sums.md
```

Already set up? Say `run V3R1T4S on sixth-powers-equal-sums`. Your agent follows [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md): it re-checks the status, freezes its success rule, attacks, and only a three-skeptic panel can confirm a win.
