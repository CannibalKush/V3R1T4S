## Reference scheme file (not shipped: third-party data)

The reference count comes from Perminov's file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dronperminov/FastMatrixMultiplication/master/schemes/results/addition_reduced_ZT/4x5x7_m104_cr400_fv163_cn931_ZT_reduced.json (sha256 of the copy the author fetched on 2026-10-15: 0c4cb3e3de6b9a820a3d231be3be5137d9791e513cfb297ef55dadced2793931). Its expanded U, V and W rows are the same products as this object's; only the straight-line programs differ. To recount the reference, download it and run verify-it-yourself/check_slp.py on it; the author's counter reproduces its cr value.
